# binder-R-anova
An R [binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment built to enable following along with the [***ANOVA in R* tutorial found here**](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/anova-in-r/) from [datanovia](https://www.datanovia.com/en/).

**Click this launch binder badge to access the environment:**

This session only lasts as long as you're using it. Files can be uploaded to it and downloaded from it, but nothing will remain on the session/in the environment when it sits idle for too long (I think this might be like 10 minutes) or after it is closed. Clicking the launch badge again will open a new one with no retained files or work. But it will enable following along with the tutorial and using it on our own files if we upload them and then download any results we want to keep afterwards ðŸ™‚
